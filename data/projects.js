    description: "Payote was created to help with some of the issues we experienced at Juicer around invoicing. A lot of companies needed custom invoices from us that contained their address or VAT numbers or other customizations and Stripe doesn't allow this, so we'd have to create the invoices manually. Payote also gives you an embeddable widget so customers can view and customize their past invoices themselves.",

Then it was shut down, and I found all the other alternatives unsatisfactory: Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal...they were all too ugly and complicated. I wanted something simple and clean.
